USAID,"Request for Sole Source Award to the National Organization for Victim Advocacy (NOVA) BACKGROUND: USAID seeks to complete this non-competitive action in support of its stated goals of advancing respectful, inclusive, and safe workplaces by advancing trauma-informed investigations and support services for members of USAID’s workforce who have been impacted by sexual misconduct within or in connection to USAID’s workplace or facilities. Services include the development of a customized trauma-informed investigations training program for USAID personnel as well as training and credentialing support for USAID personnel providing support to individuals impacted by sexual misconduct. This action will support goals outlined in the USAID’s Three-Year Plan for Preventing and Responding to Sexual Misconduct and Workplace Violence, as well as new requirements included in Automated Directives System 113, Preventing and Addressing Sexual Misconduct, which states: USAID staff responsible for conducting inquiries or investigations into sexual misconduct will complete mandatory training related to empathic and/or trauma-informed investigative practices on a recurring basis, not to exceed 3 years between successive trainings, to ensure that personnel remain well-prepared and up-to-date in addressing the complexities of sexual misconduct cases while placing importance on the well-being of all involved parties, with a particular focus on reducing potential harm or re-traumatization for impacted persons while maintaining the integrity of the investigation. Such training may include content related to concepts such as: informed consent and empowerment, psychological safety, privacy and confidentiality, empathy, self-awareness, personal self-care, and resilience. SPECIFIC TO THE REQUIREMENT: USAID intends to procure support services to advance efforts to prevent and effectively respond to sexual misconduct while providing trauma-informed investigations and support to individuals impacted by such issues. Services will first and foremost consist of the development and delivery of a virtual 12-hour customized trauma-informed investigations training for USAID personnel who conduct inquiries and investigations into sexual misconduct incidents. At a secondary level, the services will support the enrollment and participation in NOVA’s Victim Assistance Academy (NVAA) for select USAID personnel, as well as additional support to secure related credentials for those personnel through the National Advocate Credentialing Program (NACP). These services will strategically augment efforts under USAID’s Impacted Person Support pilot program to expand the availability of victim/survivor/impacted person-centered and trauma-informed investigations and support services as a means of better empowering and supporting impacted persons in the wake of harmful incidents, reducing the potential for secondary harm or trauma as a result of engaging with Agency systems and processes, and decreasing potential organizational and reputational risks to the agency as a result of failing to fulfill its basic responsibilities and/or duty of care of individuals impacted by such issues. Specific objectives included under this award include: The development of a customized training for USAID that will be delivered virtually and then recorded for future use. This process will include: Subject Matter Expert recruitment.

USAID,"While USAID’s Regional Mission in Ukraine (USAID/Ukraine) relies on its own translation team to handle its routine translation and interpretation needs, the volume of these assignments varies greatly from day to day, and may not always be expeditiously addressed due to both time and capacity constraints. With these considerations in mind, USAID/Ukraine plans to continue using services of external vendors to tackle this “overflow” of translation and interpretation work at a level of quality that should meet the expectations of its internal customers. The two vendors that USAID/Ukraine has used for that purpose in the recent years have been: Mr. Dmytro Shkryoba, a freelance interpreter/translator; and TRIS translation agency. Having monitored their performance during that time (also using feedback from internal Mission customers), our conclusion is that both vendors have performed their assignments successfully. In the last two weeks, together with the Senior Procurement Agent here at the Mission, we have done market research using quotes from several local providers of translation/interpretation services to see if the rates that the current vendors are offering to continue their work for USAID/Ukraine are competitive on the local market. Based on the analysis, and on the knowledge of their past performance, it appears that the two current vendors are offering the best value for the money that the Mission is willing to expend on these services. Therefore, I would recommend that the contracts with both Mr. Shkryoba and TRIS be renewed or extended, as the case may be, using the rates they are offering for the new/extended contract period.",,https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/jsp/viewLinkController.jsp?agencyID=7200&PIID=72012119P00028&modNumber=P00014&idvAgencyID=&idvPIID=&contractType=AWARD,"$54,713 "
